# Using a Breadboard

## Level
Beginner

## Time Estimate
15 minutes

## Overview
Master the essential tool for prototyping electronics: the solderless breadboard. This module teaches you how breadboards work internally, how connections are made, and best practices for building clean, organized circuits. You'll learn to identify power rails, terminal strips, and how to efficiently lay out components for your Arduino projects.

## Prerequisites
- Introduction to Arduino & IDE
- Blinking an LED

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the internal structure of a breadboard
- Identify power rails, terminal strips, and the center divider
- Build organized, functional circuits without soldering
- Learn breadboard best practices and common mistakes to avoid
- Create a multi-LED circuit using proper breadboard technique
