**Level:** Beginner

**Time Estimate:** 20 minutes

Welcome to the "Hello World" of Arduino! In this module, you'll make an LED blink - the first step every maker takes. You'll learn how LEDs work, why resistors are crucial, and how to control outputs with code. This simple project teaches fundamental concepts that apply to controlling any electronic device.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How LEDs work and why polarity matters
- The purpose of current-limiting resistors
- Using pinMode() to configure pins
- Controlling outputs with digitalWrite()
- Creating timing with delay()
- Building your first interactive circuit
