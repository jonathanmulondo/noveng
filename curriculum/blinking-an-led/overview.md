# Blinking an LED

## Level
Beginner

## Time Estimate
10 minutes

## Overview
Learn to control your first physical output with Arduino by blinking an LED on and off. This classic "Hello World" of hardware teaches you how to use digital output pins, control timing with delays, and understand the basics of circuit completion. You'll write code that makes an LED flash at regular intervals, giving you hands-on experience with Arduino's most fundamental capability.

## Prerequisites
- Introduction to Arduino & IDE

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to set pin modes (INPUT vs OUTPUT)
- Use digitalWrite() to turn pins HIGH and LOW
- Control timing with the delay() function
- Wire a simple LED circuit with a current-limiting resistor
- Successfully upload and run your first interactive Arduino project
