00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
Well, on the other hand, we have the analog pins labeled from A0 all the way to A5.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.600
These are made for reading smooth, continuous signals from sensors like light, temperature

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.160
and rotation.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.240
When using sensors like the LDRs and the temperature sensors, instead of just going from high or

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.559
low, these analog pins give readings in the range from 0 to 1023.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.160
So if you're going to be using projects that are modeling things in the real world, well

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.480
you'll be using these pins a lot.
