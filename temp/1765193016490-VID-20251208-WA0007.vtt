Hello, this is an Arduino UNO. So you may be wondering what is this device here?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.680
Well basically it's a small microcontroller board that lets you

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.600
control electronics using code. You can power this device using a USB cord that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.320
looks like this. Very fancy right? When you plug this cord into your laptop and

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:32.880
you plug into this port right here of the Arduino, you see the LEDs come on

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.840
and turn on like that. And that means that the board is now receiving power.
