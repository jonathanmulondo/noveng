00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Well, what we have today here is a breadboard as well.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.640
So this is just a temporary workspace for you as you're building circuits without soldering.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.440
So it's good to note that you have two different sections of a breadboard.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.200
You have this section which appears twice at the top and at the bottom and you also

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.320
have the middle section.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.160
So what's the most important thing to know about a breadboard?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.879
Well for this top section, it's good to know that the rails are connected horizontally

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.759
you can say, along like this up to the very end.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:41.680
So usually you have a plus and a minus, this represents the 5 volts and the other is usually

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
the ground.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.200
It's the same story down here.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.000
Whereas here in the middle, the rails are connected vertically.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.200
So whatever is for the same vertical line, if you plug in a wire here, it'll be at the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.439
same potential or have the same voltage as a pin along the same line, but a few dots

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.439
below.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:01.439
So that's one thing you should know.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.439
