00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Well, let's have a quick tour of our Arduino board. Well, it has very

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.640
Important sections such as the 3.3 and the 5 volts together with the ground for my components

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.320
This is our power area

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.440
we also have the digital and the analog pins for connecting sensors and

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:24.059
Outputs and then we have the microcontroller chip right over here at the center

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.879
Well, this is the actual brain actually running the program that we upload over here

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:32.759
We have the USB port for uploading code

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.279
We also have a reset button right over here in the corner

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.720
Just in case your project locks up or in case you need to you know

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.400
Reset your robot or whatever you be programming and then we have the TX and the RX

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.959
LEDs that blink whenever data is being sent or received knowing these basics makes wiring easier and much more fun
